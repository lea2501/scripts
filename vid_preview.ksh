# `-show-streams` Show all streams found in the video. Each video has usualy two streams (video and audio).
# `head -n1` We care only about the video stream which comes first.
# `sed 's/.*=//'` Grab everything after `=`.

#if [ "$NB_FRAMES" = "N/A" ]; then
    # as a fallback we'll use ffmpeg. This command basically copies this video to /dev/null and it counts
    # frames in the process. It's slower (few seconds usually) than ffprobe but works everytime.

    # I know, that `awk` and `sed` parts look crazy but it has to be like this because ffmpeg can
    # `-nostats` By default, `ffmpeg` prints progress information but that would be immediately caught by `grep`
    #     because it would contain word `frame` and therefore output of this entire command would be totally
    #      random. `-nostats` forces `ffmpeg` to print just the final result.
    # `-i "$VIDEO"` Input file
    # `-vcodec copy -f rawvideo` We don't want to do any reformating. Force `ffmpeg` to read and write the video as is.
    # `-y /dev/null` Dump read video data. We just want it to count frames we don't care about the data.
    # `awk ...` The line we're interested in has format might look like `frame= 42` or `frame=325`. Because of that
    #     extra space we can't just use `awk` to print the first column and we have to cut everything from the
    #     beggining of the line to the term `fps` (eg. `frame= 152`).

# `-loglevel panic` We don’t want to see any output. You can remove this option if you’re having any problem to see what went wrong
# `-i "$VIDEO"` Input file
# `-y` Override any existing output file
# `-frames 1` Tell `ffmpeg` that output from this command is just a single image (one frame).
# `-q:v 3` Output quality where `0` is the best.
# `-vf \"select=` That's where all the magic happens. Selector function for [video filter](https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/FilteringGuide).
# # `not(mod(n\,58))` Select one frame every `58` frames [see the documentation](https://www.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#Examples-34).
# # `scale=-1:120` Resize to fit `120px` height, width is adjusted automatically to keep correct aspect ration.
# # `tile=${COLS}x${ROWS}` Layout captured frames into this grid
